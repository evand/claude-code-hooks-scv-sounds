# Claude Code SCV Sounds

Makes Claude Code play StarCraft SCV voice lines when you use it.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Open it in Claude Code
3. That's it - the hooks are automatically active for this project

The `.claude/settings.json` contains project-specific hooks that play sounds
from `.claude/sounds/`.

## How it works

- **Start Claude Code**: "SCV good to go, sir!"
- **Submit a command**: Random acknowledgment sound
- **Stop session**: Random completion sound
